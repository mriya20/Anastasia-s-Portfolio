            <p>
                "I was born in Ukraine, city of Mykolayiv and moved to the States 11 years ago. When
                everyone thinks of Ukraine they imagine
                Siberia back in their head, without thinking that Ukraine IS NOT RUSSIA.
                I grew up in the South of Ukraine by the Black Sea. Most of my summers I spent by the beach
                in Crimea. The most sweetest and warm memories come from there. I have been heartbroken
                twice, when Crimea was taken over by Russia in 2014 and February 24th, when russia began the
                war in Ukraine.
                My hometown was attacked on the second day of the war, while my mom and my younger brothers
                were at home. They had to find a bunker near by, but in reality it was a basement of my
                middle-school.
                One of my brothers is disabled, he is on the wheelchair so in my head I was planning the
                escape plan for them. It took me 5 days to find a vehicle with a driver who would take them
                to the border of Moldova. For those 5 days I couldn't eat or sleep, I slept 2 hours each
                with no exagerattion. While watching the news and seeing my coutnry at war.
                My family succsessully reached Germany after 6 days on the road.
                When I met this summer, I saw the pain in their eyes.
                My point is here, live every day to the fullest, enjoy the NOW, not the past or the future.
                I love travelling, photography, being active, paddle boarding is my absolute favorite. Being
                in the nature is so healing.
                My background is in marketing feild and I've worked with small businesses for the past 5
                years. I'm very excited to be a part of this bootcamp.
                Happy Coding! "
